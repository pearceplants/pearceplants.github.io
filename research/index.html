        <p>Although the below page describes my primary research interests in taxonomy, systematics, and evolution of plants, with a focus on the genus <em>Ribes</em>, they are not comprehensive. I am interested in most aspects of native plants, including their ecology, conservation, and cultivation, with a soft spot for the Compositae, Apiaceae, and plants of dryland and alpine ecosystems.</p>

        <h2>Ribes Systematics</h2>
        <p><em>Ribes</em> is a genus of 150–200 species of plants commonly known as ‘currants’ and ‘gooseberries’. It displays remarkable diversity in flower and fruit characteristics, making it a useful system for studying plant evolution. However, the evolutionary relationships between <em>Ribes</em> species are still poorly understood. I am interested in using a combination of morphology (physical traits) and phylogenetics (comparison of gene sequences) to resolve these evolutionary relationships.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, species-level diversity in <em>Ribes</em> is still poorly understood, especially in ‘diversity hotspot’ areas such as China and Mexico, where it is known that there are many <em>Ribes</em> species, but these species and the boundaries between them are still largely unknown, and have not been studied in some time. Many <em>Ribes</em> species in these areas await formal scientific description, and I am keenly interested in combining morphological, geographic, and molecular data to describe these taxa. (A comprehensive set of species concepts and robust phylogeny for <em>Ribes</em> is, to speak, my white whale.)</p>
        <p>My current project involves reevaluating the species boundaries and phylogenetics of the “desert gooseberries” (<em>Ribes</em> series <em>Microphylla</em>), a poorly understood group in need of revision. I found that most of the morphological characters being used to differentiate among these taxa were actually unsuitable for this purpose, and proposed a mix of morphological, geographic, and phenotypic data to identify desert gooseberry species.</p>
        <p>I have presented this project at many conferences, including the Botanical Society of America annual conference in Palm Springs in July 2025, and the Utah Conference on Undergraduate Research in March 2025.</p>
        <p>The phylogenetic component of this project is still ongoing in our lab in the Science Research Initiative at the University of Utah, with plans to publish a manuscript next year.</p>

        <h2>Floral trait evolution in <em>Ribes</em></h2>
        <p>It is thought that the evolution of flowers, and their subsequent specialized relationships with pollinators, were a primary factor in the explosive diversification of the Angiosperms in the early Cretaceous. I am interested in understanding which selective pressures (such as pollinator selection, or abiotic factors such as temperature) drive shifts in the traits of flowers, and how those shifts cause diversification and speciation of plants.</p>
        <p><em>Ribes</em> is a genus with striking diversity in flower form, color, and size. In addition, the species within many of the clades in <em>Ribes</em> have highly similar vegetative traits to one another, mainly differing in their flowers. This implies that floral trait divergence may be a dominant force catalyzing speciation in the genus. Thus, <em>Ribes</em> provides a promising model system for understanding which biotic and abiotic factors cause shifts in floral traits, and how these shifts can drive speciation.</p>
        <p>I hope to explore this topic in depth during graduate school. If you’re interested in collaborating and think your program would be a good fit for me, <a href="/contact/">let’s get in touch</a>!</p>
